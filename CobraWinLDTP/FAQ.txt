Q: Why "from ldtp import *" is failed on Windows 7/8 ? Error message is "Access is denied".
A: Generally this failure is due to UAC. We can disable UAC then reboot machine or explicitly run cmd.exe as
administrator to solve the problem.

Q: Why hasstate('Window', 'Object', state.FOCUSED) value is incorrect ?
A: Some window focus doesn't work, so you have to call first grabfocus('Window', 'Object') and then call hasstate.
This could be an issue during verification, but we have to live with it, sorry.
